      <h2><u>More About Me</u></h2>
      <p>
        <h3>Technical Contributions:</h3>
        Before joining University of Florida, I worked for Mercedes-Benz Research and Development India Pvt. Ltd. (MBRDI) as a Software Consultant for 2+ Years. My expertise in Object-Oriented Programming helped me contribute to the 3D Master Wiring Harness Team in numerous ways. Some of my contributions are mentioned below:
        <br><br>
        1. Contributed to the development of NX Add-Ons on Siemens NX, a CAD application, for the 3D Master Wiring Harness Team - primarily focused on <b>C# (.Net Framework), ASP.NET, NX Open APIs, CI/CD process, as well as agile methodology.</b> The NX-AddOns, a suite of supplementary CAD tools, customized to optimize the performance of our wiring harness design team in India. These tools were meticulously crafted to align seamlessly with the specifications provided by our esteemed German RD counterparts. 
        <br><br>
        2. Implemented <b>3 NX Add-Ons</b> from scratch, using C#, and was responsible for the overall bug fixes, future enhancement and renovation of <b>12 NX Add-Ons out of 60 tools</b> tailored for the RD colleagues. 
        <br><br>
        3. Conceived, designed, and developed Tool Package, a WinForms Desktop Application, using <b>C# (.Net Framework & .Net Core), WinForms, HTML 5, CSS 3, and XML.</b> Being active in a CI/CD workflow, we implemented new enhancements regularly. However, the manual process of transferring essential files and folders to the shared drive proved to be error-prone, causing unnecessary bug fix tickets. Thus, the development of Tool Package <b>enhanced the efficiency of the CI/CD process</b> by offering a seamless one-click solution. It <b>reduced the delivery time by an impressive 6000%</b>, nullified redundant tickets, and got <b>nominated for "My First Innovation"</b> under Product and Business Innovation categories. 
        <br><br>
        4. Pioneered Smoke Test, a WinForms Desktop Application, built on <b>C# (.Net Framework), and WinForms, integrated with UiPath</b> to automate the <b>testing of over 60 NX Add-On tools.</b> The application runs all the tools on a master harness, generates a .CSV file with the test results of each tool, and captures screenshots of all the runs, whether the tool ran successfully or encountered errors, in a new "SmokeTestResult" folder. This crucial application is <b>used every 6 months in the NX roll-out process</b> to identify the faulty tools and promptly inform the developers.

        <br><br>

        <h3>Leadership & Extra-Curricular Experience:</h3>
        Having excellent public relationship management skills, I took up various leadership roles and organized numerous extra-curricular activities at a departmental and organizational level for MBRDI and a few notable ones during my undergrad, showcasing cross-functional collaboration. Some of the key roles mentioned below:
        <br><br>
        1. As the Brand Ambassador of Home of Tech community, I actively contributed to its growth, generating awareness and promoting the technological communities at a departmental level. We saw an increase of 1000+ users within the first few months. 
        <br><br>
        2. Spearheaded the Virtual IT & EE Event, TechFlame, under the Campus Connect initiative to discover the top talents from best colleges and universities in India. Being incharge, my team and I orchestrated the whole event from ideation to execution successfully.
        <br><br>
        3. Being the Innovation Catalyst, I drove innovation within the department for 500+ colleagues by conducting campaigns to explore new opportunities, collaborate and cooperate with others to implement cutting-edge solutions, and apply for patents, if applicable. We also assisted the teams by providing the right platform for them to showcase their innovations at the organizational level.
        <br><br>
        4. Organised a successful Virtual Fresher's Meet-&-Greet for 50+ Student Intern Trainees joining MBRDI in February 2022 and GET Onboarding Sessions, tailored to the needs of 50+ GETs joining MBRDI in July 2022, alongside a team of dedicated volunteers.
        <br><br>
        5. Moderator for the CAD CoC Shopfloor Workshop for the Year 2022, facilitating knowledge-sharing and collaboration within the CAD CoC for 250+ colleagues. 
        <br><br>
        6. Served as the SPOC for Fun Brigade at the departmental level, conducting engaging employee activities and competitions to enhance team morale and foster a positive work environment. The Fun Brigade team also conducted TechCARnival, a week-long celebration for IT India at MBRDI, in Year 2022 for more than 2500+ colleagues.
        <br><br>
        7. Elected as the Vice President of Computer Society of India and I had the privilege of coordinating and leading a team of 350+ students from the ISE and CSE branches in organizing the highly successful 33rd CSI State Level Convention, held at the esteemed Dayananda Sagar Academy of Technology and Management, with participation from over 30 colleges and universities.
        <br><br>
        8. As the Department Student Coordinator & Representative, I successfully spearheaded 5 Competitive Coding Challenges, organized 3 Project Expos, and coordinated 7 workshops in collaboration with renowned companies across India, including Bosch Rexroth India Ltd, GeeksLab Technologies Pvt Ltd, CyberCure Technologies, and more.
        <br>
        As a member of the Official Media Club at Dayananda Sagar Academy of Technology and Management, I represented the Computer Science and Engineering Department in meetings, providing bi-weekly updates.
        <br>
        I took the initiative to organize and conduct Departmental Clubs for the Computer Science Department at Dayananda Sagar Academy of Technology and Management. These clubs offered students the opportunity to join any two clubs of their choice, including options like Coding Club, Music Club, Arts and Culture Club, Dance Club, Literature Club, and Photography and Videography Club. 
        <br>
        Additionally, I successfully coordinated and conducted the Departmental Fest for the academic year of 2019-20, called Exe.bit 2k19. This event, held at the CSE Department, provided a platform for students to showcase their talents and skills in various domains. It was a memorable experience, fostering a sense of camaraderie and enthusiasm within the department. Also served as part of the media crew, capturing the essence of the event.
