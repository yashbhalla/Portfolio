# Portfolio

This repository contains my portfolio created using a front-end tech stack comprising HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Developed during ShellHacks 2023—a hackathon hosted by FIU in Miami, FL—this project was guided by Kristoff Little, Support Engineer at Microsoft. Over a 24-hour period, I leveraged my skills to build and host this portfolio on GitHub Pages for public access.
